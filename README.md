This solution requires the use of **Proxy servers**, either your own proxy servers or you can use [Apify Proxy](https://www.apify.com/docs/proxy).

##### Tip

When you want to have a scrape over a specific item URL, just copy and paste the link as one of the **startUrl**.

If you would like to scrape only the first page of a list then put the link for the page and have the `endPage` as 1.

With the last approach that explained above you can also fetch any interval of pages. If you provide the 5th page of a list and define the `endPage` parameter as 6 then you'll have the 5th and 6th pages only.

### Compute Unit Consumption

The actor optimized to run blazing fast and scrape many as items as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all item detail requests. If actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 items in 1 minute with ~0.04-0.06 compute units.

### Trustradius Scraper Input example

```json
{
  "startUrls":[
    "https://www.trustradius.com/users/5c24577c4452bb002b85451a",
    "https://www.trustradius.com/search?t=product&q=food",
    "https://www.trustradius.com/search?t=vendor&t=product&q=food",
    "https://www.trustradius.com/products?q=food",
    "https://www.trustradius.com/vendors?q=food"
  ],
  "includeReviews":true,
  "proxy":{
    "useApifyProxy": true
  },
  "search":"pro",
  "mode":"all",
  "maxItems": 5000,
  "endPage": 2
}


```

## During the Run

During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified.
When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## Trustradius Export

During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any languague (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this Trustradius actor.
